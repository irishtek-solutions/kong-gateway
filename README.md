## Plugins

Plugins extend the functionality of the Kong Gateway. Plugins allow you to easily add new features and functionality to your API. They offer the ability to do things like: 

- Authentication
- Rate Limiting
- Security
- Transformations
- And moreâ€¦

Plugins can be applied globally or scoped to specific services, consumers or routes. This section gives a breakdown of plugins and how to configure them. 

- Here is a link to our [plugin hub](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/) which has documentation for all available plugins.
